              Artificial intelligence technologies are starting to be actively utilized in human life, to
              carry out various activities. Devices are getting smarter in their ways to interact with
              both a person and among themselves. New capacities cause creation of varied systems
              for integration of smart things into Social Networks of the web of Things. One of the
              relevant trends in AI is that the technology of recognizing what a person is saying and
              responding accordingly and that has given birth to voice assistants. New insights within
              this topic can cause new means of natural human-machine interaction, during which the
              machine would find out how to understand a human's language, and also adjust and
              interact in it.<br /><br />

              One of such tools is voice assistant, which may be integrated into many other intelligent
              systems. Today voice assistants are capable of responding to our voice based commands
              and perform tasks such as searching on the web, replying to texts, and activities to the
              extent of having a normal meaningful conversation with us.<br /><br />

              This paperconsist of explaining the principles of the functioning of an A.I. Voice
              Assistant and describe its main shortcomings and limitations as well. It also
              covers the future aspects, applications of the system and most importantly define how
              it is different from other voice assistants that are already available in the form of Siri,
              Alexa etc. Finally It consist a method of making an AI Voice Assistant without
              using cloud services and thus no user data being collected is described, which allows us
              to significantly expand the applicability of such devices within the future.
              In this Project we have worked to make a voice assistant that uses Machine Learning for
              its working. <br /><br />

              Our voice Assistant can be divided into 4 different components<br /><br />
              1. Wake word detection<br />
              In this module we discuss what is a wakeword, how we used it in our project.
              What steps we took while developing it and how well it performs.<br /><br />
              2. Automatic speech Recognition<br />
              This module talks about how we converted our voice into text format, so that it
              can be further processed.<br /><br />
              3. Natural Language Understanding<br />
              In this module, we give information and detailed steps of how our voice
              assistant tries to make sense of what the user has said and do the task told by the
              user.<br /><br />
              4.Speech Synthesis<br />
              This is the last module describing our Voice Assistant, this module is about how
              the voice assistant will generate sound waves and talk back to the user.<br /><br />
